# weather-data.yml
#
# A workflow to be run by GitHub Actions on a scheduled basis (daily at 10am).
# The workflow checks out the repository, executes the weather station script
# (weather.sh) for weather station Athenry and checks the respository back in 
# with the newly retrieved weather information.
# It also includes a workflow_dispatch event so it can be tested manually.
# The file is written in yaml.
